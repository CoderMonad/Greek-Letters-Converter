# Greek-Letters-Converter

This is a program that I've written in a bunch of different languages that will take a number into convert it into a set of Greek letters. Because I've got a bunch of different languages I'll put them all here in one Repository with different folders between them all. (I tried with different branches but it got really confusing).

I write this program because it is simple and generally helps me grasp a new language when I am trying to learn it.

It has no point other than being simple. 

**Everything is released into the public domain so do what you will with them.**

I may or may not update this; because as I've said I'm trying to just put the random code bits I've made throughout the years all on GitHub as a central place to be able to reference them.

Because the program generates the result with 5 letters the maximum number (which would yield "Omega Omega Omega Omega Omega") is 8,308,824

I could, of course, add another letter which would extend the maximum to 199,411,800 but it doesn't really seem necessary.
