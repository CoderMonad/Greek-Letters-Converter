# Greek-Letters-Convertor
This is a program that I've written in a bunch of different languages that will take a number into convert it into a set of Greek letters. Beacuse I've got a bunch of different languages I'll put them all here in one Repository with different branches than have a bunch of repositories. Each language will have its own branch.

I write this program because it is simple and generally helps me grasp a new language when I am trying to learn it.

It has no point other than being simple. 

They are all released in the public domain so do what you will with them.

I may or may not update this; because as I've said I'm trying to just put the random code bits I'ver made throughout the years all on Github as a central place to be able to reference them.
