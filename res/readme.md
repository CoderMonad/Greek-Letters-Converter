##Resources Folder

This folder holds resources that are used by the program. 

Currently it holds the Icon I use for the program, as well as the boilerplate which hold infomation about the program that can be seen in the complied .exe

I tried to make the boiler depend on a defined value by Code::Blocks to get the correct version.h

## Icon Credit

Credit for the Icon I use goes to [Icons8] (https://icons8.com/).

You can find the orginal [Here](http://www.iconarchive.com/show/ios7-icons-by-icons8/Science-Alpha-icon.html).

No changes have been made to the file.
